# Self-Care Center

### Abstract:
I built out the comp of a webpage. I added functionality to the radio buttons and receive button so that the user can choose the message genre they/'d like. The app allows for users to get positive quotes to improve their mood. Users can see all of the messages before the messages start to repeat.
